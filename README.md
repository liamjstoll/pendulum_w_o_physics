# pendulum_w_o_physics
Simulates a pendulum. Haven't added any physics. Keyboard 'Q' to quit.

to compile: g++ pendulum.cpp -w -lSDL2    


The lengths of the lines, rotation directions, and speeds are hard-coded.
Could change those values to user input.

Could also add physics - gravity, motion, energy conservation.
But I'm not gonna try to do that in C++
